# AUX

AUX is a collection of useful Cocoa (mainly UIKit) categories with a goal of having no (inter)dependencies and good test coverage.

Category names as well as added methods are all vendor-prefixed.

For block-related categories, check out [BlocksKit](https://github.com/pandamonia/BlocksKit).

## Usage

To use, simply copy the `.h`/`.m` pair into your project. As the categories are very limited in scope and are tested, they usually shouldn't change much in the future.

CocoaPods support in a bit!
