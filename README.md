# AUX

AUX is a collection of Cocoa (mainly UIKit) categories with test coverage and no (inter)dependencies.

Category names have a prefix `X` while category methods start with `x_`.

## Usage

Via Cocoapods, add the following source to your Podfile:

    source 'https://github.com/appscape/AUX.git'

then add a subspec:
  
    pod 'AUX/Log'
    pod 'AUX/NSData'
