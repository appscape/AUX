# AUX

AUX is a collection of useful Cocoa (mainly UIKit) categories with a goal of having no dependencies and good test coverage.

Category names as well as added methods are vendor-prefixed.

## Usage

To use, simply copy the .h/.m pair into your project. As the categories are very limited in scope and tested, they usually shouldn't change much in the future.
